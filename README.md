# **UX**
## Project Goals:

The goal of this project is to create a site that implements the [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) functionality. 
The users who wish to avail of the site will be able to create their own **online Cookbook**, 
allowing them to **create**/upload recepies, **read** through their existing resipies/sample recipies
stored on the site, **update** their recipies and to **delete** recipes.

## User Stories
As a user I would want/expect my Personal Cookbook:   
* To be able to **create** my own recipes to an online site.
* To **view** all my recipes easily.
* **Edit** recipes.
* **Update** my recepies.
* **Deleted** recipes I no longer want.
* Filter recipes into **categories** e.g breakfast, lunch and dinner to make it easier to view.
* For the website to be **responsive** on different devices.
* Be able to **delete** or **change** my **username/password/account** if I please.

## User Goals
* To be **responsive** on mobile, table and destop devices.
* Include different **categories** when searching for a recipe e.g breakfast.
* Website to **protect** the **users information**.
* Website to be easy to use and **visually** **appealing**.
* Website to easily allow the user to create, edit, read and delete recipes.

# **Structure**
The Website will consist of serveral pages.   
## **Home Page:**
This is the main page of the website that will consist of some information
about function of website and **sample recipes** so the user can visualise what the recipie will look like.   
The **navbar** which is fixed to the top of the page, will consits of a **logo, login and register** options.   
The **footer** will contain some **social media** icons.

## **Register Page:**
The navbar will be the same as the home page along with the footer. 
This page will contain a simple form to allow the user to register to the website.
The **form** will contain a **username**, **password** and **confirm password** textareas to allow the user to get set up and a **submit** button.   

## **Login Page:**
Again, the navbar and footer will be the same and contain another form to allow the user to enter their **username** and **password** and a **login button**. 
The form will have validation so if the user enters the wrong username or password an alert will pop up to advise the user that the information isinncorrect and to try again.

## **User account home page:**
When the user has logged into the website, the **navbar** will be amended to include a **logo, home, my recipies, my account dropdown**. 
The **dropdown** option will contain **edit account, delete account, logout**.   
The body of the page will contain the user name e.g *Sophie's Cookbook* and a small paragraph informing the user how the Cookbook works.   
There is a **add recipe button** under the paragraph to allow the user to get started.

# **Wireframes**
My Wireframes:  
[Desktop](https://github.com/SophieH93/MS3/tree/master/wireframes/desktop
)   
[Tablet](https://github.com/SophieH93/MS3/tree/master/wireframes/tablet)  
[Mobile](https://github.com/SophieH93/MS3/tree/master/wireframes/mobile)   
[Flowchart](https://github.com/SophieH93/MS3/tree/master/wireframes/flowchart)

I created my wireframes using [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/) for various devices.
The **edit recipe** page will be the same as the **add recipe** page hence I did not create an official woreframe for this page.   
The **delete recipie** will display a pop up to confirm with the user if they actually want to delete the recipe.
